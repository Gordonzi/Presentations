<h1>Lecture 12: Complexity vs. Simplicity Part I: Effective Software Development Processes &#8211; Scrum, XP, and Lean</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Software Development Process</h1>
<p>Ideally, a software development process helps us:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan the project,
	<ul>
		<li>Timeline, including the delivery schedule.</li>
		<li>Resources required.</li>
		<li>Itemize and prioritize the deliverables that will be created.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Execute on the plan.</li>
	<li>Deliver on time and under budget.</li>
	<li>Meet quality objectives.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Project Planning</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If a project is truly innovative, you cannot possibly know its exact cost and exact schedule at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; John Gavin, Director of the Lunar Module Program, in an article in M.I.T.&#8217;s Technology Review, 1994, and quoted in his obituary on November 4, 2010 in the <a href="http://nyti.ms/a2yPRN">New York Times</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Do We Plan?</h1>
<p>We <em>really</em> want to predict the future:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is the project feasible?</li>
	<li>What is the <em>real</em> cost of a project?
	<ul>
		<li>Will the <em>benefits</em> outweigh the <em>costs</em>?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Will the project finish on time to meet market needs and/or deadlines?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Central Dilemma of Project Management</h1>
<p>We can never have <em>perfect knowledge</em> at the beginning of a project to know these answers.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We can never think of every possible <em>contingency</em>.</li>
	<li>Events outside our control can upset our careful plans.</li>
	<li>We are <em>learning</em> about the project as we do it.
	<ul>
		<li>Sometimes we learn answers to questions we couldn&#8217;t answer at the beginning.</li>
		<li>Other times we gain new perspectives from our long engagement with the project.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Plans vs. Reality, I</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy&#8217;s main strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or put more simply,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army for 30 years.</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Plans vs. Reality, II</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Plans are nothing; planning is everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces, World War II.</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Then, Why Bother With Planning?</h1>
<p>Because it&#8217;s the start of our learning process.</p>
<p>Because we still need to sign contracts, plan strategies, etc.</p>
<p>So, we need to get as close to the ideal goals as possible, just not <em>delude</em> ourselves! Hence, project planning and processes address:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Risk reduction strategies.</li>
	<li>Iterations and prioritizing features.</li>
	<li>Feedback loops, for learning and &#8220;course correction&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Risk Reduction Strategies</h1>
<p><em>Contingency planning</em> is a venerable technique for trying to anticipate every possible contingency and deciding how each will be handled.</p>
<p>That usually means identifying a list of risks and who you will respond to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Potential Risks</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Changes in the marketplace.</li>
	<li>Technical aspects of the project are not yet understood.</li>
	<li>Technical aspects of the project might prove impossible.</li>
	<li>The pace and/or cost of development might be slower than anticipated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Risk Reduction</h1>
<p>But no amount of &#8220;thinking&#8221; and planning can remove all risk. As the war quotes imply, you have to adapt as circumstances change.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important benefit of contingency planning is the way it prepares you to be on your guard and to be adaptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Iterations and Prioritizing Features</h1>
<p>For every project, some features (requirements) are more important than others. Think about the evolution of mobile phones. While we love having email and web browsing on &#8220;smart&#8221; phones, it was important first for phones to make and receive calls! Voice mail and lists of phone numbers came next, etc.</p>
<p>A common mistake: <em>work on the stuff that&#8217;s easiest or most fun first, rather than the stuff that&#8217;s most important.</em></p>
<p>In general, it&#8217;s far better to get minimal features released sooner.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Feedback Loops</h1>
<p>Releasing <em>early and often</em> means you can get feedback from your <em>stakeholders</em> early and often.</p>
<p>Hence, you learn and adapt. Some &#8220;must have&#8221;, but unimplemented features might become less important, while new features grow in importance.</p>
<p>Sometimes projects, even companies, change completely!</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Project Execution</h1>
<ul>
	<li>How do we get to working, delivered software that <em>meets the requirements</em>?</li>
	<li>How do we stay within budget and quality goals?</li>
	<li>What artifacts must be delivered?</li>
	<li>What techniques help us achieve these goals?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Delivery on Time and Under Budget</h1>
<p>Suppose you are building the main stadium for the next Olympic games. You have an obvious hard deadline for completion.</p>
<p>Still, what actually gets finished is somewhat flexible. You might cut back on the amenities and ornamentation, while you can&#8217;t cut back on safety and facilities, like adequate rest rooms ;)</p>
<p>Similarly, even when there are hard deadlines for a software project, often the secondary features can be deferred until later.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Qualities of an Effective Process</h1>
<p>The need for feedback and &#8220;course correction&#8221; means that any successful software development process must embrace <em>iterative and incremental development</em> (<span class="caps">IID</span>).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Iterative</strong> &#8211; The process is divided into time increments (usually of fixed duration).</li>
	<li><strong>Incremental</strong> &#8211; The features are implemented to completion one at a time, not all at once.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Software Processes and Complexity</h1>
<p>All successful products (not just software) release as early as possible with minimal, but essential features. Later, they expand (and sometimes grow bloated).</p>
<p>A universal principle, repeated over and over again, is that successful systems, avoid <em>unnecessary complexity</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Kinds of Complexity</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of complexity:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Essential</strong> &#8211; Inherent in the problem domain. Unavoidable.</li>
	<li><strong>Accidental</strong> &#8211; Complexity added to the implementation that is not necessary and is detrimental.<br />
<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Make everything as simple as possible,<br/>but not simpler.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Software Processes: A History</h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at few of the most influential development models in the history of software process thinking.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Waterfall Model of Software Development</li>
	<li>Rational Unified Process</li>
	<li>Agile Methodologies</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>
<center>
<img src="images/Waterfall.png"></img>
</center>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>
<p>This process looks orderly, controlled, predictable. Real projects posses none of those qualities! Real projects require feedback, iteration, and incremental delivery of features.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>
<p>The Waterfall Process resulted from a historical accident.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> During the 60s, many researches recognized the importance of iterative development. One paper was &#8220;Managing the Development of Large Software Systems&#8221;, by Winston Royce, in Proceedings of <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Westcon.</p>
<p>This paper started with an image similar to the one two slides ago, <em>but</em> it went on to argue that such a process <em>can&#8217;t work</em>, because feedback is required.</p>
<p><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Craig Larman, &#8220;Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager&#8217;s Guide&#8221;, pp 102-107.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>
<p>Tragically, when the DoD decided to draft a standard for software development based on this paper, the standard&#8217;s author ignored the feedback aspects and focused on the top-down discussion. In part, this decision reflected other influential trends of the time. (Larman discusses this in detail.)</p>
<p>The result was a deeply flawed approach to development that became an influential standard around the world. It caused a lot of failed projects before it was overturned.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall: What Was Missing</h1>
<center>
<img src="images/WaterfallWithFeedback.png"></img>
</center>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Process Science</h1>
<p>In fact, feedback loops are a &#8220;Process 101&#8221; requirement. Pick any <em>other</em> process or similar &#8220;throughput-oriented&#8221; sequence of events, such as manufacturing, chemical engineering, electrical circuits. All would <em>fail</em> without feedback loops.</p>
<p>There are stories that software process experts were laughed at when they described waterfall to process experts in other fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Successors to Waterfall</h1>
<p>In the late 80s and 90s, successors emerged that restored the important roll of iterations and feedback. Most were also tied to <span class="caps">OOP</span>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting and influential was the <em>Rational Unified Process</em> (<span class="caps">RUP</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Rational Unified Process (<span class="caps">RUP</span>)</h1>
<p>Many considered Rational Corporation to be the leading expert in software development through much of the 80s and 90s. The term <em>Unified</em> was tied to the their <em>Unified Modeling Language</em> (<span class="caps">UML</span>) that they created by merging the separate approaches of the <em>Three Amigos</em>: Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson.</p>
<p>(Booch was one of the original employees. Rumbaugh and Jacobson joined in the mid-90s, after establishing their reputations independently.)</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Rational Unified Process (<span class="caps">RUP</span>)</h1>
<p>While <span class="caps">RUP</span> embraced <span class="caps">IID</span>, it treated each iteration as a mini Waterfall, with some requirements gathering, some design, and more implementation and testing.</p>
<p>This approach reflected concerns about the <em>cost of change</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Cost of Change</h1>
<p>A <em>cardinal rule</em> at the time; the longer a defect (requirement error, design flaw, bug) goes undetected in a project, the more expensive it is to fix, because the cost of <em>rework</em> goes up, the later in a project the defect is detected. In the most severe cases, such defects can even kill projects!</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Cost of Change</h1>
<p>While true, this concern had the practical affect of encouraging <em>waterfall thinking</em> to persist:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We <em>must</em> get the requirements right first!</li>
	<li>We <em>must</em> design the code before implementing it!</li>
	<li>If we do the above, the implementation will be <em>mechanical</em>, predictable, and (mostly) bug free!</li>
</ul>
<p>(<span class="caps">RUP</span> wasn&#8217;t alone in this thinking.) We&#8217;ll see that XP solved this problem in a more effective way.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Cost of Change</h1>
<p>So, in practice, organizations following <span class="caps">RUP</span> (and similar approaches) were often doing waterfall development anyway, while paying lip service to incremental and iterative development. For example, since Rational was a big advocate of modeling with <span class="caps">UML</span>, <span class="caps">RUP</span> strongly recommended design by modeling&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Long Range Planning</h1>
<p>Another problem was the tenacious belief that long-range plans can and should be followed. When they weren&#8217;t followed, it was considered a failure of the <em>users</em> of the process, rather than the process itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Too Prescriptive</h1>
<p>Because of this fear of defects (and let&#8217;s face it, because it was a commercial product and they needed stuff to sell), <span class="caps">RUP</span> became a very <em>prescriptive</em> process that defined a huge number of <em>roles</em> and <em>responsibilities</em> for every little aspect a project might encounter.</p>
<p>You were supposed to <em>instantiate</em> <span class="caps">RUP</span> for your situation, meaning pick the roles and responsibilities that made sense for your needs.</p>
<p>Rational (and independent consultants) made a lot of money on training and <em>instantiating</em> <span class="caps">RUP</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Too Prescriptive</h1>
<p>Also, there is a subset of the population that <em>likes</em> the world to be prescriptive, to tell them what to believe, what to do, and when.</p>
<p>However, remember our generals? While armies have lots of roles and responsibilities, <em>successful</em> armies also understand the need to be flexible, not rigid, to break out of the artificial boxes when circumstances demand it.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Strengths and Weaknesses of <span class="caps">RUP</span></h1>
<p>+ Recognized the importance of feedback and <span class="caps">IID</span>.<br />
- Too prescriptive.<br />
- It didn&#8217;t eliminate waterfall thinking.<br />
- Based on an inadequate solution to the cost of change problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>At the end of the 90s, during the Internet bubble, it quickly became apparent to many people that the &#8220;state of the art&#8221; for software development was too bloated and inefficient for <em>Internet time</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>The first tech startup I worked for then tried to use <span class="caps">RUP</span>, because &#8220;that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do&#8221;. For example, we still tried to model what we were doing, and we even hired a guy whose sole job was to model the requirements and the system we were building.</p>
<p>This was stupid, in retrospect, given the rapidly changing marketplace and our attempts to find a successful niche.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>Other companies I worked for later on knew enough to abandon <span class="caps">UML</span> modeling, etc., but they had no alternatives in mind. They simply adopted ad hoc techniques, like hiring QA departments to test the &#8220;heck&#8221; out of our code after it was written.</p>
<p>The result? Lots of end-of-project overtime to fix serious flaws and production failures at inopportune times as the poor quality code failed frequently.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t actually all that fun to write software&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>But other practitioners explored <em>principled</em>, yet <em>efficient</em> and <em>effective</em> approaches to the inherent problems of software development.</p>
<p>That is, just because we were on <em>Internet time</em>, it didn&#8217;t mean all the old development challenges mysteriously vanished, but they could be addressed in ways that fit the times.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Agile Manifesto</h1>
<p>In February, 2001, 17 leaders from various <em>lightweight methodology</em> camps meet at the Snowbird Ski Resort. They wanted to look for and document shared principles and practices. Some in attendance later expressed surprise that they achieved what they did, given the tendency for people to cling to their own ideas.</p>
<p>They adopted the term <em>agile</em> as an umbrella term for their shared philosophy of effective software development. They drafted a simple <em>agile manifesto</em> to express that philosophy&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Agile Manifesto</h1>
<p>&#8220;We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Individuals</strong> and <strong>interactions</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>processes</strong> and <strong>tools</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Working software</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>comprehensive documentation</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>contract negotiation</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Responding to change</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>following a plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the <em>right</em>, we value the items on the <em>left more</em>.&quot;</p>

<h1>Three Agile Methods: Scrum, XP, and Lean<br />
  <br />
While there are several different agile methods mentioned, we&#8217;ll discuss the three most popular.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></h1>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Scrum</strong> &#8211; focuses on project management.</li>
	<li><strong>XP</strong> &#8211; a complete, small-team approach, addressing project management and developer practices.</li>
	<li><strong>Lean</strong> &#8211; inspired by Toyota Lean, &#8220;Just-in-Time&#8221; Manufacturing.</li>
</ul>
<p><sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> See Highsmith&#8217;s &#8220;Agile Software Development Ecosystems&#8221; for an excellent survey of the major agile methods (in 2002).</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Three Agile Methods: Scrum, XP, and Lean</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ll describe these Scrum and XP, then mention Lean, as they were originally conceived, using original terminology. Today, they have borrowed heavily from each other, so you&#8217;ll encounter hybrid terms and processes in most organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Scrum</h1>
<p>Developed in the mid-90s. First public presentation at <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span> &#8217;95.</p>
<p>Named after the <em>scrum</em> in Rugby, where a team huddle&#8217;s together to move the ball down the field. It is used as a metaphor for the frequent, quick, daily <em>standup</em> meetings done by teams and the philosophy that the whole team works together to deliver the software.</p>
<p>Why have meetings standing up? Because you get tired quickly, so you get them over with quickly!</p>

<h1>Life of a Sprint</h1>
<p>A <strong>sprint</strong> starts with a <strong>sprint planning meeting</strong>, where the <strong>scrum master</strong> and <strong>product owner</strong> present the highest priority work left on the <strong>project backlog</strong> to the team. The team decides <em>for itself</em> how much of the backlog it can complete in the next sprint. It usually captures this information in hour estimates. (This meeting lasts at most 1/2 day.)</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Life of a Sprint</h1>
<p>Once the team has agreed on the <strong>sprint backlog</strong>, i.e., the work to be done in the sprint, the <strong>sprint backlog</strong> is <em>frozen</em> for the whole sprint. This has a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It minimizes churn for the team.</li>
	<li>It makes it easier to gather reliable metrics of how much work the team completes per sprint, on average.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Daily Scrum</h1>
<p>Each day, at the same time and place, they have a <strong>daily scrum</strong>, lasting no more than 15 minutes. Each team member answers three questions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What have you done since yesterday?</li>
	<li>What are you planning to do today?</li>
	<li>Do you have any problems preventing you from accomplishing your goal?</li>
</ol>
<p>All other discussions are deferred until after the scrum.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Life of a Sprint</h1>
<p>The sprint ends with two meetings (often combined into one).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sprint Review</strong> &#8211; What was accomplished? Demo for the product owner. Time boxed to 4 hours.</li>
	<li><strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong> &#8211; What worked and didn&#8217;t work in the last sprint? What can we do to improve going forward? Time boxed to 3 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h1>A &#8220;Retrospective&#8221; on Scrum</h1>
<p>Scrum has been the first agile process adopted by many organizations &#8211; the <em>gateway drug</em>, if you will.</p>
<p>+ Largely drove mainstream adoption of Agile.<br />
+ Focused on program management issues &#8211; a good place to start for improving teams.<br />
+ It&#8217;s easy to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>A &#8220;Retrospective&#8221; on Scrum</h1>
<p>- 30 day sprints are now seen as too long in most organizations.<br />
- It ignored developer activities, which eventually undermine successes, e.g., due to lack of testing and poor quality, leading to <em>technical debt</em>.<br />
- <em>Certified Scrum Master</em> training became a &#8220;degree-mill&#8221; kind of embarrassment. The false sense of &#8220;expertise&#8221; led to many failed projects.</p>

<h1>Extreme Programming (XP)</h1>
<p>Started with the now-famous <em>C3 Project</em> started in &#8217;96, a payroll system at <em>Chrysler</em>, written in Smalltalk. <em>Kent Beck</em> was brought on to do Smalltalk performance consulting, but he quickly introduced process improvements based on his prior work with <em>Ward Cunningham</em>. <em>Ron Jeffries</em> was also brought in as a consultant.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Extreme Programming (XP)</h1>
<p>The lessons learned from this experience led Beck to write perhaps the most influential book on software process in the last few decades, &#8220;Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change&#8221;, in 2000.</p>
<p>(A significantly rewritten 2nd Edition was published in 2005. If you can find the first edition, it&#8217;s worth reading, too. Many people felt the first edition was better.)</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Extreme?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The first time I was asked to lead a team, I asked them to do a little bit of the things I thought were sensible, like testing and reviews. The second time there was a lot more on the line. I thought, &#8220;Damn the torpedoes, at least this will make a good article,&#8221; [and] asked the team to crank up all the knobs to 10 on the things I thought were essential and leave out everything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; Kent Beck in an interview he and Martin Fowler did with  <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=20972">informit.com</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Extreme? (cont.)</h1>
<p>XP pushes ideas to their logical <em>extremes</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hard to gather requirements? Put the customer <em>in the same room</em>.</li>
	<li>Is quality an issue? Write your tests <em>before</em> your code.</li>
	<li>Are designs hard to keep consistent with code? Design <em>while</em> you code.</li>
	<li>Documentation grows obsolete? Make the <em>code and tests</em> the documentation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Values, Principles, Practices</h1>
<p>One of the beauties of XP is the emphasis on &#8220;first principles&#8221;, namely a set of <em>values</em> that drive a set of <em>principles</em> that are realized through a set of <em>practices</em>. A benefit of this foundation is the way it encourages teams to adapt the practices to their needs, subject to the values and principles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll summarize the <em>values</em> and <em>principles</em>, then highlight a few of the <em>practices</em>.  Note that these sets have evolved somewhat over the last decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>XP Values</h1>
<p>The word <em>value</em> implies a measure of importance, merit, etc. The XP values are designed to maintain focus on the long-term objectives.<br />
<div class='small'></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Communication</strong> &#8211; Direct communication is more effective than documentation.</li>
	<li><strong>Simplicity</strong> &#8211; Start simple and add features as needed.</li>
	<li><strong>Feedback</strong> &#8211; Several forms of feedback effectively guide the project.</li>
	<li><strong>Courage</strong> &#8211; Aggressively make any kind of change that directs the project towards its goals.</li>
	<li><strong>Respect</strong> &#8211; Show respect for the rest of the team in several tangible ways.<br />
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>XP Principles</h1>
<p><em>Principles</em> are foundational truths that guide actions. They are more concrete than the values.<br />
<div class='small'></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Rapid Feedback</strong> &#8211; Learning is faster and cost of change is lower if feedback is sooner.</li>
	<li><strong>Assume Simplicity</strong> &#8211; Don&#8217;t build needlessly for the future.
	<ul>
		<li><em>What is the simplest thing that could possibly work?</em></li>
		<li><em>You ain&#8217;t gonna need it.</em> (<span class="caps">YAGNI</span>)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>Incremental Change</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s easier make progress incrementally.</li>
	<li><strong>Embrace Change</strong> &#8211; Strict control and predictability is a myth.</li>
	<li><strong>Quality Work</strong> &#8211; Be proud of your work &#8230;</li>
	<li>Other less central principles&#8230;<br />
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>XP Practices</h1>
<p>XP started with a well-defined set of <em>required</em> practices, required because they are <em>synergistic</em>. Picking some (usually the easiest ones) and skipping others is a recipe for failure!</p>
<p>Today, the practices are often stated in less concrete terms, recognizing that the ideal specifics can vary from one organization to another.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most important (and sometimes controversial) practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>On-site Customer</h1>
<p>If communication is key, e.g., to gather and refine requirements, you can reduce barriers to communication by having the customer sit next to you.</p>
<p>Communication through documents is a <em>low bandwidth</em> form of communication.</p>
<p>Communication through meetings doesn&#8217;t provide rapid feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Planning Game and Small Releases</h1>
<p>Various techniques are used to spend the minimum amount of time possible actually planning, especially for the next <em>iteration</em> (<em>sprint</em> in Scrum terms).</p>
<p>Standup meetings, as described for <em>Scrum</em> are used in XP, too.</p>
<p>Small releases promote rapid feedback, force simplicity, and promote incremental change.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Testing and Simple Design</h1>
<p>In <em>Test-Driven Development</em> (<span class="caps">TDD</span>), you write <em>automated</em> tests <em>before</em> the code required to make the tests pass!</p>
<p>The automated tests:</p>
<ul>
	<li>help you think through design first.</li>
	<li>keep you focused on the task at hand.</li>
	<li>catch regressions in the future&#8230;
	<ul>
		<li>&#8230; which gives you <em>courage</em> to <em>refactor</em>.</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the <em>design</em> part is the <em>most important benefit</em> of <span class="caps">TDD</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Refactoring</h1>
<p>Restructuring the system in a way that <em>preserves the existing behavior</em>, but</p>
<ul>
	<li>removes <em>duplication</em> and other code <em>smells</em>,</li>
	<li><em>improves</em> the structure for implementing the <em>next feature</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>The <span class="caps">TDD</span> Cycle</h1>
<center>
<img src="images/TDDCycle.png"></img>
</center>
<div class='small cite'> (adapted from various sources)</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1><span class="caps">TDD</span> Demo</h1>
<p><em><strong>Demo</strong> &#8211; A <span class="caps">TDD</span> session using Eclipse</em></p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Pair Programming</h1>
<p>&#8220;Two heads are better than one&#8221;.</p>
<p>When two people work together on the code:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They review and improve the design as they go (automatic code reviews).</li>
	<li>They minimize dead ends.</li>
	<li>When one gets blocked, the other takes over.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the most controversial <span class="caps">TDD</span> technique. Some hate it. However, it does tend to improve overall quality considerably.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Collective Ownership</h1>
<p>Anyone can change any part of the code at any time. There are no compartmentalized sections. Everyone is responsible for the quality of the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Continuous Integration</h1>
<p>Every time code is committed to source control, the full suite of automated tests are run to detect any <em>integration</em> breakages. This goes a long ways towards keeping the code <em>always read to ship</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>40-Hour Work Week</h1>
<p>Mentally tired and frustrated developers do substandard work&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>A Few Other Points About XP</h1>
<ul>
	<li>User Stories</li>
	<li>Story Points</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>User Stories in XP</h1>
<p>Requirements are documented using <em>user stories</em>, how a user would use the system to do an activity. (They are somewhat similar to the older <em>Use Cases</em> and <em>Scenarios</em>, just less formal.) Framed this way keeps requirements focused on delivering user value and helps avoid wasting time on bells and whistles.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Story Points</h1>
<p>How do you estimate the time it will take to implement a story? Using hours or days is difficult, because no one actually works 8-hour days.</p>
<p>Also, <em>absolute</em> estimates are very hard for us to get right.</p>
<p>But, people are naturally good at <em>relative</em> estimates. So, use an arbitrary metric, <em>points</em>, and as a team, develop an intuitive feel for which stories are 1 point, which are twice as hard (2 points), etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Lean Software Development</h1>
<p>We&#8217;ll only mention this, due to time limitations. It is the approach that has gained traction most recently. It addresses some of the limitations of XP for larger organizations, and refines several ideas about agility.</p>
<p>While all agile methods are inspired to one degree or another by Toyota&#8217;s <em>Lean</em> or <em>Just-In-Time</em> manufacturing, <em>Lean Software Development</em> tries to push the concepts as far as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Lean Software Development</h1>
<p>There&#8217;s one important <em>risk</em> that has to be <em>avoided</em>. It&#8217;s tempting to treat software development as a <em>manufacturing process</em>, to exploit the successes of the latter. But this analogy is flawed, because the &#8220;manufacturing&#8221; stage for software is the <em>build process</em>, which is (or should be) straightforward and fully automated. Rather, software development is more like the <em>creative engineering process</em> that went into designing the product in the first place and figuring out how to build it, before it reaches the manufacturing floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Push vs. Pull</h1>
<p><em>Lean</em> is a <em>pull model</em> rather than a <em>push model</em>.</p>
<p>Scrum and XP have fixed-length iterations, where stories (or tasks) are <em>pushed</em> into the sprint/iteration backlog.</p>
<p>Lean doesn&#8217;t use iterations. Rather, as the team finishes one story, it <em>pulls</em> a new story from the backlog, providing a more continuous flow. In Toyota manufacturing, this is related to the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>.</p>
<p>For many teams, this model is more natural than fixed-length iterations.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Summary: Universal Themes</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Short, time-boxed iterations and incremental releases.</li>
	<li>Continuous customer feedback.</li>
	<li>Developer testing to virtually eliminate bugs.</li>
	<li>Whole-team collaboration and responsibility.</li>
</ul>
