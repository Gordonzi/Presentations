<h1>Lecture 12: Complexity vs. Simplicity Part I: Effective Software Development Processes &#8211; Scrum, XP, and Lean</h1>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Software Development Process</h1>
<p>Ideally, a software development process helps us:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Plan the project,
	<ul>
		<li>Timeline, including the delivery schedule.</li>
		<li>Resources required.</li>
		<li>Itemize and prioritize the deliverables that will be created.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Execute on the plan.</li>
	<li>Deliver on time and under budget.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Project Planning</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If a project is truly innovative, you cannot possibly know its exact cost and exact schedule at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; John Gavin, Director of the Lunar Module Program, in an article in M.I.T.&#8217;s Technology Review, 1994, and quoted in his obituary on November 4, 2010 in the <a href="http://nyti.ms/a2yPRN">New York Times</a>.</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Do We Plan?</h1>
<p>We <em>really</em> want to predict the future:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is the project feasible?</li>
	<li>What is the <em>real</em> cost of a project?
	<ul>
		<li>Will the <em>benefits</em> outweigh the <em>costs</em>?</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Will the project finish on time to meet market needs and/or deadlines?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Central Dilemma of Project Management</h1>
<p>We can never have <em>perfect knowledge</em> at the beginning of a project to know these answers.</p>
<ul>
	<li>We can never think of every possible <em>contingency</em>.</li>
	<li>Events outside our control can upset our careful plans.</li>
	<li>We are <em>learning</em> about the project as we do it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Plans vs. Reality, I</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy&#8217;s main strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or put more simply,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No plan survives contact with the enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, Chief of Staff of the Prussian Army for 30 years.</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Plans vs. Reality, II</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Plans are nothing; planning is everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Forces, World War II.</div>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Then, Why Bother With Planning?</h1>
<p>Because we still need to get as close to the ideal goals as possible. So, project planning and processes have to address:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Prioritizing features.</li>
	<li>Risk reduction strategies.</li>
	<li>Learning as you go.</li>
	<li>Feedback loops and iterations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Prioritizing Features</h1>
<p>For every project, some features (requirements) are more important than others. Think about the evolution of mobile phones. While we love having email and web browsing on &#8220;smart&#8221; phones, it was important first for phones to make and receive calls! Voice mail and lists of phone numbers came next, etc.</p>
<p>A common mistake: <em>work on the stuff that&#8217;s easiest or most fun first, rather than the stuff that&#8217;s most important.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Risk Reduction Strategies</h1>
<p><em>Contingency planning</em> is a venerable technique for trying to anticipate every possible contingency and decide how it will be handled.</p>
<p>That usually translates to identification of potential risks and responses to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Potential Risk</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Market changes.</li>
	<li>Technical aspects of the project are not yet understood.</li>
	<li>Technical aspects of the project prove not feasible.</li>
	<li>The pace of development is slower than anticipated.</li>
	<li>The cost of development is slower than anticipated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Risk Reduction</h1>
<p>But no amount of &#8220;thinking&#8221; and planning can remove all risk. As the war quotes imply, you have to adapt as circumstances change. Perhaps the most important benefit of contingency planning is the way it prepares you to adapt as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Project Execution</h1>
<ul>
	<li>How do we get to working, delivered software that <em>meets the requirements</em>?</li>
	<li>How do we stay within budget and quality goals?</li>
	<li>What artifacts must be delivered?</li>
	<li>What techniques help us achieve these goals?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Delivery on Time and Under Budget</h1>
<p>Suppose you&#8217;re building the main stadium for the next Olympic games. You have an obvious hard deadline for completion.</p>
<p>Still, what actually gets finished is somewhat flexible. You might cut back on the amenities and ornamentation, while you can&#8217;t cut back on safety and facilities, like adequate rest rooms!</p>
<p>Similarly, even when there are hard deadlines for a software project, often the secondary features can be deferred until later.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Qualities of an Effective Process</h1>
<p>The need for feedback and &#8220;course correction&#8221; means that any successful software development process must embrace <em>iterative and incremental development</em> (<span class="caps">IID</span>).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Iterative</strong> &#8211; The process is divided into time increments (usually of fixed duration).</li>
	<li><strong>Incremental</strong> &#8211; The features are implemented to completion one at a time, not all at once.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">IID</span> lets you</p>
<ul>
	<li>Solicit feedback from &#8220;stakeholders&#8221;.</li>
	<li>Deliver limited functionality earlier rather than later!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Software Processes and Complexity</h1>
<p>All successful products (not just software) release as early as possible with minimal, but essential features. Later, they expand (and sometimes grow bloated).</p>
<p>A universal principle, repeated over and over again, is that successful systems, processes, tools, etc. avoid <em>unnecessary</em> complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Kinds of Complexity</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of complexity:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Essential</strong> &#8211; Inherent in the problem domain. Unavoidable.</li>
	<li><strong>Accidental</strong> &#8211; Complexity added to the implementation that is not necessary and is detrimental.<br />
<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Make everything as simple as possible,<br/>but not simpler.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class='cite'>&#8212; Albert Einstein</cite></div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Software Processes: A History</h1>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at two of the most influential concepts in the history of software process thinking.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Waterfall Model of Software Development</li>
	<li>Rational Unified Process</li>
	<li>Agile Methodologies</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>
<center>
<img src="images/Waterfall.png"></img>
</center>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>
<p>This process looks orderly, controlled, predictable. Real projects posses none of those qualities! Real projects require feedback, iteration, and incremental delivery of features.</p>
<p>The Waterfall Process resulted with a historical accident!<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> During the 60s, many researches recognized the importance of iterative development. One paper was &#8220;Managing the Development of Large Software Systems&#8221;, by Winston Royce, in Proceedings of <span class="caps">IEEE</span> Westcon.</p>
<p>This paper started with an image similar to the one on the previous slide, but it went on to argue that such a process can&#8217;t work, because feedback is required.</p>
<p><sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Craig Larman, &#8220;Agile and Iterative Development: A Manager&#8217;s Guide&#8221;, pp 102-107.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall Model of Software Development</h1>
<p>Tragically, when the DoD decided to draft a standard for software development based on this paper, the author ignored the feedback aspects and focused on the top-down discussion. In part, this decision reflected other influential trends of the time. (Larman discusses this in detail.)</p>
<p>The result was a deeply flawed approach to development that became an influential standard around the world. It caused a lot of damage before it was overturned.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Waterfall: What Was Missing</h1>
<center>
<img src="images/WaterfallWithFeedback.png"></img>
</center>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Process Science</h1>
<p>In fact, feedback loops are a &#8220;Process 101&#8221; requirement. Pick any <em>other</em> process or similar &#8220;throughput-oriented&#8221; sequence of events, such as manufacturing, chemical engineering, electrical circuits. All would <em>fail</em> without feedback loops.</p>
<p>There are stories that software process experts were laughed at when they described waterfall to process experts in other fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Successors to Waterfall</h1>
<p>In the late 80s and 90s, successors emerged that restored the important roll of iterations and feedback. Most were also tied to <span class="caps">OOP</span>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting and influential was the <em>Rational Unified Process</em> (<span class="caps">RUP</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Rational Unified Process (<span class="caps">RUP</span>)</h1>
<p>Many considered Rational Corporation to be the leading expert in software development through much of the 80s and 90s. The term <em>Unified</em> was tied to the their <em>Unified Modeling Language</em> (<span class="caps">UML</span>) that they created by merging the separate approaches of the <em>Three Amigos</em>: Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson.</p>
<p>(Booch was one of the original employees. Rumbaugh and Jacobson joined in the mid-90s, after establishing their reputations independently.)</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Rational Unified Process (<span class="caps">RUP</span>)</h1>
<p>While <span class="caps">RUP</span> embraced <span class="caps">IID</span>, it treated each iteration as a mini Waterfall, with some requirements gathering, some design, and more implementation and testing.</p>
<p>This approach reflected concerns about the <em>cost of change</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Cost of Change</h1>
<p>A <em>cardinal rule</em> at the time; the longer a defect (requirement error, design flaw, bug) goes undetected in a project, the more expensive it is to fix, because the cost of <em>rework</em> goes up, the later in a project the defect is detected. In the most severe cases, such defects can even kill projects!</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Cost of Change</h1>
<p>While true to an extent, it had the practical affect of encouraging <em>waterfall thinking</em> to persist:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We <em>must</em> get the requirements right first!</li>
	<li>We <em>must</em> design the code before implementing it!</li>
	<li>If we do the above, the implementation will be <em>mechanical</em>, predictable, and (mostly) bug free!</li>
</ul>
<p>(<span class="caps">RUP</span> wasn&#8217;t alone in this thinking.)</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Cost of Change</h1>
<p>So, in practice, organizations following <span class="caps">RUP</span> (and similar approaches) were often actually doing waterfall development, while paying lip service to incremental and iterative development. For example, since Rational was a big advocate of modeling with <span class="caps">UML</span>, <span class="caps">RUP</span> strongly recommended design by modeling&#8230;</p>
<p>Another symptom of this was the belief that long-range plans can and should be followed. When they weren&#8217;t followed, it was considered a failure of the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Too Prescriptive</h1>
<p>Because of this fear of defects (and let&#8217;s face it, because it was a commercial product and they needed stuff to sell), <span class="caps">RUP</span> became a very prescriptive process with way too many <em>roles</em> and <em>responsibilities</em> identified for all kinds of minutiae.</p>
<p>You were supposed to <em>instantiate</em> <span class="caps">RUP</span> for your situation, that is pick the roles and responsibilities that made sense for you.</p>
<p>Rational (and independent consultants) made a lot of money on training and <em>instantiating</em> <span class="caps">RUP</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Drawbacks of <span class="caps">RUP</span> &#8211; Too Prescriptive</h1>
<p>Also, there is a subset of the population that <em>likes</em> the world to be prescriptive, to tell them what to believe, what to do, and when.</p>
<p>However, remember our generals? While armies have lots of roles and responsibilities, <em>successful</em> armies also understand the need to be flexible, not rigid, to break out of the artificial boxes when needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Strengths and Weaknesses of <span class="caps">RUP</span></h1>
<p>+ Recognized the importance of feedback and <span class="caps">IID</span>.<br />
- Too prescriptive.<br />
- Based on an incorrect understanding of the cost of change.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>At the end of the 90s, during the Internet bubble, it quickly became apparent to many people that the &#8220;state of the art&#8221; for software development was too bloated and inefficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>I worked for a few tech startups in that era that tried to use variations of <span class="caps">RUP</span>, because &#8220;that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to do&#8221;. For example, we still tried to model what we were doing, which was stupid, in retrospect, given the rapidly changing marketplace and our attempts to find a successful niche&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>I worked for a few other organizations that knew enough to abandon <span class="caps">UML</span> modeling, etc., but they had no alternatives in mind. They simply adopted ad hoc techniques, like hiring QA departments to test the code after it was written.</p>
<p>The result? Lots of end-of-project overtime to fix serious flaws; crises 24&#215;7 as the poor quality code caused problems in production.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Birth of the Agile Movement</h1>
<p>But other practitioners explored <em>principled</em>, yet <em>efficient</em> and <em>effective</em> approaches to the inherent problems of software development.</p>
<p>That is, just because we were &#8220;on Internet time&#8221;, it didn&#8217;t mean all the old challenges mysteriously vanished!</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Agile Manifesto</h1>
<p>In February, 2001, 17 leaders from various <em>lightweight methodology</em> camps meet at the Snowbird Ski Resort. They wanted to look for and document shared principles and practices. Some later expressed surprise that they achieved what they did, given the tendency for people to cling to their own ideas.</p>
<p>They adopted the term <em>agile</em> as an umbrella term for their shared philosophy of effective software development. They drafted a simple <em>agile manifesto</em> to express that philosophy&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Agile Manifesto</h1>
<p>&#8220;We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Individuals</strong> and <strong>interactions</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>processes</strong> and <strong>tools</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Working software</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>comprehensive documentation</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>contract negotiation</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Responding to change</strong> <em>over</em> <strong>following a plan</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That is, while there is value in the items on the <em>right</em>, we value the items on the <em>left more</em>.&quot;</p>

<h1>Three Agile Methods: Scrum, XP, and Lean</h1>
<p>While there are several different agile methods, we&#8217;ll discuss the three most popular.<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Scrum</strong> &#8211; focuses on project management.</li>
	<li><strong>XP</strong> &#8211; a complete, small-team approach, addressing project management and developer practices.</li>

<p>I&#8217;ll describe these three processes as they were originally conceived, using original terminology. Today, they have borrowed heavily from each other, so you&#8217;ll encounter hybrid processes in most organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Scrum</h1>
<p>Developed in the mid-90s. First public presentation at <span class="caps">OOPSLA</span> &#8217;95.</p>
<p>Named after the <em>scrum</em> in Rugby, where a team huddle&#8217;s together to move the ball down the field. It is used as a metaphor for the frequent, quick, daily <em>standup</em> meetings done by teams and the philosophy that the whole team works together to deliver the software.</p>
<p>Why have meetings standing up? Because you get tired quickly, so you get them over with quickly!</p>

<h1>Life of a Sprint</h1>
<p>A <strong>sprint</strong> starts with a <strong>sprint planning meeting</strong>, where the <strong>scrum master</strong> and <strong>product owner</strong> present the highest priority work left on the <strong>project backlog</strong> to the team. The team decides <em>for itself</em> how much of the backlog it can complete in the next sprint. It usually captures this information in hour estimates. This meeting should not last more than 1/2 day.</p>
<p>Once the team as agreed on the <strong>sprint backlog</strong>, i.e., the work to be done in the sprint, the <strong>sprint backlog</strong> is <em>frozen</em> for the whole sprint (except for extraordinary circumstances). This minimizes churn for the developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Life of a Sprint</h1>
<p>The team members decide amongst themselves who will do what work.</p>
<p>Each day, at the same time and place, they have a <strong>daily scrum</strong>, lasting no more than 15 minutes. Each team member answers three questions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What have you done since yesterday?</li>
	<li>What are you planning to do today?</li>
	<li>Do you have any problems preventing you from accomplishing your goal?</li>
</ol>
<p>All other discussions are deferred until after the scrum.</p>

<p>The sprint ends with two meetings (often combined into one).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sprint Review</strong> &#8211; What was accomplished? Demo for <strong>product owner</strong>. Time boxed to 4 hours.</li>
	<li><strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong> &#8211; What worked and didn&#8217;t work in the last sprint? What can we do to improve going forward? Time boxed to 3 hours.</li>

<h1>A &#8220;Retrospective&#8221; on Scrum</h1>
<p>Scrum has been the first agile process adopted by many organizations &#8211; the <em>gateway drug</em>, if you will.</p>
<p>+ Focuses on program management issues &#8211; a good place to start.<br />
+ Easy to grasp.<br />
- 30 day sprints are now seen as too long (in most organizations).<br />
- Ignored developer activities &#8211; which eventually undermine successes (e.g., due to lack of testing and poor quality).<br />
- <em>Certified Scrum Master</em> training became a &#8220;degree-mill&#8221; kind of embarrassment. The false sense of &#8220;achieved expertise&#8221; has led to many failed projects.</p>

<h1>Extreme Programming (XP)</h1>
<p>Started with a now-famous project, a payroll system at Chrysler, written in Smalltalk, that began in 1996. Kent Beck brought on to do Smalltalk performance consulting, but he quickly introduced process improvements based on his prior work with Ward Cunningham. Ron Jeffries was also brought in as a consultant.</p>
<p>Beck wrote perhaps the most influential book on software process in the last decade, &#8220;Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change&#8221;, 2nd Edition (2005). (This was a significant rewrite. If you can find it, it&#8217;s worth reading the original edition, published in 2000.)</p>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Why Extreme?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The first time I was asked to lead a team, I asked them to do a little bit of the things I thought were sensible, like testing and reviews. The second time there was a lot more on the line. I thought, &#8220;Damn the torpedoes, at least this will make a good article,&#8221; [and] asked the team to crank up all the knobs to 10 on the things I thought were essential and leave out everything else.</p>

<h1>Why Extreme? (cont.)</h1>
<p>XP Tries to push ideas to their logical extreme.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hard to gather requirements? Put the customer in the same room.</li>
	<li>Is quality an issue? Push testing to <em>before</em> coding.</li>
	<li>Designs hard to keep consistent with code? Design as you code.</li>
	<li>Documentation grows obsolete? Make the code, including the tests, be the documentation.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Universal Themes</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Short, time-boxed iterations and incremental releases.</li>
	<li>Continuous customer feedback.</li>
	<li>Developer testing to virtually eliminate bugs.</li>
	<li>Whole-team collaboration and responsibility.</li>
</ul>
