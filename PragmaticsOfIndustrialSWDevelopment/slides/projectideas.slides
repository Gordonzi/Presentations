h1. Appendix: Final Project Ideas

Recall that you will need to do a short presentation on the last class day, where you discuss a small aspect of the long-running project. This "aspect" could include extending the stock application with a new feature, doing a non-trivial calculation with the MongoDB database directory, or another topic related to the course.

The following list is designed to give you ideas, but I'm open to other ideas. Please select a topic to work on and discuss it with me by November
