This is a remarkably trivial package that makes simply HTML-based presentations 
from a set up source files written using Textile. It's designed to help when 
creating slides that contain lots of code, as it allows code to be embedded from 
external source files. This means that the code that you embed can come from 
running (and tested) programs.

The code in the resulting slides is syntax highlighted, and is hyperlinked to 
the original source file, allowing that file to be brought up in Textmate.

To get started

* make sure you have Ruby 1.8.7 installed, along with the Rake and redcloth gems
* type 'rake all' in the same directory as this README file
* open html/all.html

To use the code examples
1) Any .java file can be compiled with the javac command.
2) Any *_example.scala file must be executed directly with the "scala" command.
3) Any other *.scala file must can be compiled with the "scalac" command. 
Do these compiles first, as some of the *_example.scala files depend on these compiled files.
Note: some files won't compile because they elide some of the code.

See the file LICENSE for details on how all this may be used.
