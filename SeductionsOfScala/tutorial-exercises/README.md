Here are the exercises for the tutorial. We may not have time for all of them. The file names follow this convention:

* **exN-name.scala:** The file defining exercise number **N**, with name **name**.
* **exN-name-solution.scala:** My solution to the exercise for Scala v2.9 and v2.10.
* **exN-name-solution-v210.scala:** (if present) My solution to the exercise for Scala that uses v2.10 features.

Of course, other solutions are often possible.

I welcome feedback on the tutorial and on these exercises!
