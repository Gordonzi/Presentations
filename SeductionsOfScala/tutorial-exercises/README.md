Here are the more exercises for the tutorial than we'll have time to do. The file names follow this convention:

* **exN-name.scala:** The file defining exercise number **N**, with name **name**.
* **exN-name-solution.scala:** My solution for exercise number **N**.
* **exN-name-solution-v210.scala:** My solution for exercise using unique features of Scala v2.10.

Of course, other solutions are often possible. 

I welcome feedback on the tutorial and on these exercises!
