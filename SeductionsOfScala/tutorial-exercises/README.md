Here are the 11 exercises for the tutorial. The file names follow this convention:

* **exN-name.scala:** The file defining exercise number **N**, with name **name**.
* **exN-name-solution.scala:** My solution for exercise number **N**.

Of course, other solutions are often possible. 

I welcome feedback on the tutorial and on these exercises!
