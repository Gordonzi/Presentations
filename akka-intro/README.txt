h2. About the Presentation

I created it using S5 and the SyntaxHighlighting project for the code samples. It's all mashed together and not very elegantly. 

To view, open @akka.html@ in a browser. 

You can navigate between pages using the arrow keys. At the lower right-hand corner is a navigation menu that appears when you mouse over it.

h2. TODO

* Clean up and unify the stylesheets.
* Fix the font sizes for tables and code samples to be smaller so they fit better.
* Prevent the center content from being hidden by the footer.

Feel free to fork the code and commit improvements.
